Good morning.

I want to talk to you today about the soul. Not the soul as that immortal unit of religious mythology, for I am a nonbeliever. And not the soul as a pop-culture commodity, that voracious consumer of self-help chicken soup. I mean the soul simply as that seismic core of personhood from which our actions, our thoughts, our ideals, radiate.

I live in New York, where something extraordinary happens every April. In the first days of spring, those days when the air turns from blistering to balmy, a certain gladness envelops the city — strangers smile at each other and give way and actually look up from their screens while walking. For a few short days, it’s like we remember how we can live and who we’re capable of being to one another.

I also practically live on my bike — that’s how I get everywhere — and the other week, on one of those first days of spring, I was going from Brooklyn to Harlem. I had somewhere to be and so I was pedaling pretty fast — which I enjoy doing and must admit I take a certain silly pride in — but I was also very much enjoying the ride and the river and the spring air and the smell of plum blossoms. And then, I sensed that somebody behind me was catching up in the bike lane, and going even faster than I was going. Suddenly it felt somehow competitive. He was trying to overtake me. I pedaled faster, but he kept catching up. Eventually, he did overtake me — and I felt strangely defeated.
